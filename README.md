Here was developed application to  sniffer data from local computer  and to read .pcap files and marshaling  its data from  C++ native code to WPF/.Net  application

I've used here https://www.tcpdump.org/pcap.html and https://pcapplusplus.github.io/  c++ library and wrap them and handle it of native c++ code

We can use as current streaming data from your computer as and download  previously saved streaming data from loaded file
